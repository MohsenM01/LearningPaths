Wikipedia:

In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

The SOLID concepts are:

The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

The Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.

The Interface segregation principle: "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
